# DidasUtils
Library with random stuff made by me!
This library is tightly linked to my Primes project, some of the content in here was made specifically for the project. Take a look at it! https://github.com/didas72/Primes

## "Modules"
While this library is more of a collection of little patches of code, this code is grouped into namespaces.

ConsoleUI provides a rudimentar UI system for Console applications
Data has a better BitArray class and a way of segmenting data into smaller chunks
ErrorCorrection has some EXPERIMENTAL methods for error checking
Extensions has extension methods
Files has a custom settings file system and a wrapper for 7za.exe
Net has some networking related functions. Some are now outdated.

## Inc
Inside Inc there is a copy of 7za.exe (not sure what version to be honest) that I use with the SevenZip class. I DID NOT MAKE 7z NOR DO I OWN IT IN ANY WAY. Visit https://www.7-zip.org/ for more info.
